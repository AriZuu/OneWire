    <li><i>What happened to the JiBKit?<br>
        <br>
        </i><strong>Answer:<br>
        </strong>The iB-IDE is a complete replacement and
        enhancement of the previous JiBKit releases.  If you
        would like to work without the tools in the <u>i</u>B-IDE,
        see the questions on <a href="#commandline">building 
        applets</a> and <a href="#hostrun">running host programs
        </a> outside of the <u>i</u>B-IDE.<br>

    <li><i>What happened to JiBMultiFactory and the
        rest of the JiBAPI?</i><br>
        <br>
        </i><strong>Answer:<br>
        </strong>The old JiBAPI has been <a href="deprecation.html">
        deprecated</a> in favor of the 1-Wire API, which will allow
        applications to access any 1-Wire device, rather than 
        just Java Powered <u>i</u>Buttons.  It also allows applications
        to use USB to communicate with <u>i</u>Buttons.  The functionality
        of <code>JiBMultiFactory</code> is now shared between <code>
        OneWireMonitor</code>, which listens for <u>i</u>Buttons to be 
        inserted and removed, and <code>OneWireContainer16</code>, which
        performs APDU communications with the Java Powered <u>i</u>Button.

    <li><em>What is Dallas Semiconductor's
        Java-Powered Crypto </em><em><u>i</u></em><em>Button?</em>
        <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        The DS Java-Powered Crypto <u>i</u>Button is a secure
        Java Virtual Machine encased in a stainless-steel
        circular container only 16mm wide. It is Java-powered and
        designed according to Sun's Java Card 2.0 specification.
        Because it has more RAM than other Java Card-based
        products, your programs can do more, and since it relies
        on battery-backed static RAM to store its applets, it can
        be programmed over and over again as needs change.
        Perhaps best of all, the <u>i</u>Button's small size
        means it can be integrated into all sorts of personal
        accessories for both safe keeping and convenience of
        use.  Find out more at http://www.ibutton.com/store/index.html.</p>
        <p>This <u>i</u>Button has a super-fast, 1024-bit modular
        math coprocessor for cryptographic operations. This is,
        in fact, the same coprocessor already proven in the DS
        Crypto <u>i</u>Button with Dallas O/S. Having such a
        coprocessor makes the Java Powered Crypto <u>i</u>Button
        ideal as a general-purpose security device, fully capable
        of performing secure transactions over the internet. </p>

    <li><i>What JDKs are supported by this developer's kit
        (iB-IDE)?</i> 
	<p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        This version was developed and tested for on JDK 1.2
        and JDK 1.3. This is a <strong>requirement </strong>to
        install and run iB-IDE, but the underlying <u>i</u>Button
        code needed to simply run <u>i</u>Button applications
        will work on JDK 1.1.x.<br>
        <br>
	This version fixes the previous problems where no JDK
	other than 1.2.1 and 1.2 would work with the <u>i</u>B-IDE.
	Future versions of the JDK <em>should</em> be compatible with
	<u>i</u>B-IDE, but as long-time users know, problems may arise
	from future JDK releases.

    </li>
<a name="3"></a><hr>
    <li><i>What platforms are supported by the iB-IDE? </i>
        <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        The iB-IDE supports Windows 9x<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font>,
        Windows NT/2000<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font>, 
	Solaris<font size="1"><sup>TM</sup></font> versions 2.5.1

    <li><i>I get the following error message when running under
        Windows:&quot;Error 2 opening registry key
        HARDWARE\DEVICEMAP\SERIALCOMM&quot;. What can I do about
        this?</i> <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        Try passing a command line parameter to the application
        that you are running. The command line parameter is the
        communications port name on your machine. Example:
        &quot;java BusinessCardDisplay COM1&quot; </p>

    <li><i>I'm running Windows NT and cannot seem to install the
        Win32 drivers. What is required to install drivers under
        Windows NT?</i> <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        In order to have &quot;permission&quot; from Windows NT
        to install drivers, you <em>must</em> be using an
        Administrator account when you install iB-IDE. Also,
        please note that in order for the NT drivers to work
        properly, you must also have Service Pack 2 or greater
        installed on your machine.</p>
        <p>NOTE: These drivers are only needed if you are using
        the DS1410E parallel port adapter. They should not be
        needed for serial port communication, since serial
        communication can be achieved using pure Java with
        the Java COMM API. </p>

    <li><i>I get the following error when I run the host
        examples: &quot;access-ibKeyOpen, timeout waiting for
        port owned&quot;. What is wrong?</i> <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        What you see are debug and test statements sent to the
        console screen used during development. This, in itself,
        is not a cause for worry. If your applet still finds the <u>i</u>Button,
        then these messages may be ignored. If not, first make
        sure that there are no other applications running that
        may be using this port. If all else fails, move your Blue
        Dot adapter to another port.</p>
        <p> </p>
    </li>
<a name="8"></a><hr>
    <li><i>Why do I keep getting an unsatisfied link error when
        trying to run the host examples?</i> <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        The most likely cause is that Java cannot find a native
        library it needs in order to continue executing. If you
        are on Windows 95 or NT, make sure that both the
        <b>ibtmjava.dll</b> (<b>iButtonLegacy.dll</b> for old <u>i</u>B-IDE 1.1x code) and
        <b>win32com.dll</b> are in the
        <i>[JDK_ROOT]\jre\bin</i> directory. If you are
        running Unix, then make sure the appropriate libraries
        can be found in the directory pointed to by the
        environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.</p>
        <p>This problem is also seen while using early betas of
        JDK 1.2. We currently recommend using the release version
        of JDK 1.2 or later.</p>
        <p>You might also see this sort of problem if you are
        running a vendor's VM other than the one provided by Sun.
        While several other vendors VM's have been shown to work
        well with these libraries, you should check with your
        vendor to find out whether their VM's are conformant to
        regular native Java standards, including where the
        appropriate libraries should reside. </p>

    <li><i>What does the return code of 0x6681 mean?</i> <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        A return code of 0x6681 indicates a security problem
        while attempting to perform a command function, such as
        running an applet. All <u>i</u>Buttons for Java have
        potential to be locked using password protection. The
        rings from JavaOne 1998 use the PIN &quot;1!J1&quot;. </p>

    <li><i>When I try to load an applet I get a return code of
        0x6903. What does that mean?</i> <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        A return code of 0x6903 is very similar to the above code
        of 0x6681, except that this code occurs as a result of <i>attempting
        to load</i> an applet. It also indicates that the master
        password supplied is incorrect. The only password used on
        Java Powered <u>i</u>Buttons supplied at Java One 1998 is
        &quot;1!J1&quot;. </p>

    <li><i>When I try to load an applet I get a return code of
        0x6902. What does that mean?</i> <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        A return code of 0x6902 (Bad API Version) means that you
        have tried to load an applet on your <u>i</u>Button that
	was built for a different <u>i</u>Button version.  To fix
	this, determine the firmware version string of your Java 
	Powered <u>i</u>Button using 
	APDUSender.  Then, under COMPILE | OPTIONS, choose the
	correct Target <u>i</u>Button Version.</p>

    <li><i>When I try to load an applet I get a return
        code of 0x6A81. What does that indicate?</i>
        <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        This error indicates that once the applet was loaded,
        there was a problem calling the install() method.
        This can be because an applet was written for the
        JavaCard 2.1 specification, while the <u>i</u>Button
        only supports the JavaCard 2.0 specification.  This error 
        can also appear if your applet is using an Abstract or
        Heirarchichal structure, where your applet either implements
        some interface or extends a class that extends a class.
        Such a scheme is legal, but you must use the '-a' option
        to identify the main applet class (BuildJiBlet versions 0.59
        and later).

    <li><i>When I try to load an applet I get a return
        code of 0x6A84. What does that indicate?</i>
        <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        This error (Class Length Overrun) can occur when
        you are trying to load a larger applet onto the
        Java Powered <u>i</u>Button.  The applet must be
        sent in packets, and transmission errors can cause
        this failure.  You can increase the packet size to
        reduce the occurance of this error.  In your code,
        add the line<br><br>
        <pre><code>	owc16.setLoadPacketSize(112);</code></pre>
        
        before you load the applet (<code>owc16</code>
        is a <code>com.dalsemi.onewire.container.OneWireContainer16</code> object). 
        The default Load Packet Size is 64.  You should not 
        go above 112 or below 64.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><i>When I try to load an applet I get a 0x6F00 
        (Uncaught Exception), and then Get Last Error returns
        a 0x64 (Internal Error). What does that indicate?</i> 
        <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        This can occur when compiling applets for the Java Powered
        <u>i</u>Button using JDK version 1.3.  We have not determined
        the exact cause yet, but believe it has something to do with 
        the JDK changing the way it handles static initializers.  If you
        encounter this error, we recommend you change to use JDK1.2,
        at least for building your applets.
    </li>


<a name="13"></a><hr>
    <li><i>What causes a return code of 0x8453?</i> <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        A return code of 0x8453 is caused by selecting an applet
        that does not exist on the Java Ring. This almost always
        occurs when a developer believes an applet has been
        loaded, but for some reason it has not. </p>
    </li>
<a name="6985"></a><hr>
    <li><i>When I try to talk to my applet I get a return
        code of 0x6985.  What does this mean?</i>
        <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        This usually happens when the applet has failed to 
        load or has not been selected before communication,
        so the Java <u>i</u>Button does not know what to do
        with your APDU.  Make sure to select the
        applet before you communicate with it.
        </p>

    <li><i>When I am talking to my applet it returns a
        status word 0x6F00.  What happened?</i></li>
        <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        A 0x6F00 means &quot;Uncaught Exception&quot;.  Either 
        an <a href="sw.html#exception">exception</a>
        was thrown from the <u>i</u>Button and
        there was no <code>try | catch</code> block around it
        (like a NullPointerException) or an <a href=
        "sw.html#error">error</a> was thrown
        that could not be 'caught' (like an OutOfMemory Error).
        To determine what happened, you can use APDU Sender
        and issue the command <b>Get Last Error</b> or in your
        code you can do something like the following:<br><br>
        <code><pre>
            if (statusWord==(short)0x6f00)
                try
                {
                    //owc16 is a OneWireContainer16 object
                    <b>ResponseAPDU response = owc16.getLastError();</b>
                    int err = 0x0ff & response.getBytes()[0];
                    System.out.print("Last Error reported as 0x");
                    if (err<16) System.out.print('0');
                    System.out.println(Integer.toHexString(err));
                }
                catch(Exception e)
                {
                    System.out.println("Could not getLastError!");
                }
        </pre></code><br>
        You can determine the meaning of the returned code from the
        <a href="sw.html">Status Word</a> document.  Make sure
        you know the firmware version of your <u>i</u>Button to determine
        the meaning of an exception.

        <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        Make sure that both types of garbage collection are enabled.
        You can do this with the APDU 
        Sender program (press F4 to start it).  There are two types
        of garbage collection: Applet and Ephemeral.  Under APDU Sender,
        there are Get and Set commands for both types.  Make sure the
        Get methods return 1.
        </p>
        <p>
        Note that unlike on a PC or workstation, garbage collection in
        the <u>i</u>Button will not begin until the <code>process</code>
        method returns.  Variables may fall out of scope, but they will
        not be available for collection until the end of the process
        method.</p>

    <li><i>Why do I get the error &quot;cannot

        <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        You probably have environment size problems. You can
        change this value in Windows 95 by pulling up properties
        on the DOS shell you are using. Under the Memory tab,
        change the Initial Environment Size to a larger value.
        Apply the changes, and try again. </p>
        <p>A similar error, &quot;NoClassDefFoundError&quot; may
        occur on the Windows 95 platforms for unknown reasons,
        and may sometimes be corrected by either (A) using the
        syntax &quot;java -classpath %classpath%
        &lt;myApplet&gt;&quot;, or (B) by changing the order of
        required jar files in the classpath so that the jar file
        used by the application for itself is last. </p>

    <li>I am writing an applet to store

        but I can't seem to send more than 255 bytes to my applet
        successfully. What's wrong? <p><b>Answer:</b><br>
        There is a bug in the Java One '98 release of the <u>i</u>Button
        for Java which prevents the array index parameter to
        &quot;sendBytesLong()&quot; from completing successfully.
        This can be worked around by sending arrays which are
        larger than 255 bytes in pieces. By iteratively sending
        smaller packets, you can successfully load an array which
        is larger than 255 bytes. (The code generated by iB-IDE
        will automatically handle this for you.) This has been
        fixed in the 1.0 release of the Java-Powered <u>i</u>Button.

        - (Java <u>i</u>Button Firmware Version 0.03.0003) have no
        modular exponentiation capabilities. This ring is
        therefore not export controlled. It does have a SHA-1
        hash class (javacardx.crypto.Sha1MessageDigest) and a
        random number generator (javacardx.crypto.Random).<br>
        <br>
        The 1.0 <u>i</u>Buttons (Java <u>i</u>Button Firware Versions
        1.00.0004, 1.01.0004, 1.02.0005, and 1.03.0005) have 
        a modular exponentiation function in
        addition to the version 0 <u>i</u>Button functions. This
        new function can be found in the
        com.dalsemi.system.Coprocessor class. This allows any
        modular exponentiation based cryptography schemes (RSA,
        DSA, etc.) to be implemented on the <u>i</u>Button. (See
        the RSASign example project in iB-IDE).<br>
        <br>
        The 1.1 <u>i</u>Buttons (Java <u>i</u>Button Firmware Versions
	1.10.0006 and 1.11.0006) have the javacardx.crypto package fully
        implemented (providing DES, RSA implementations). See the
        javacardx.crypto specification for the available
        functions.<br>

	Powered <u>i</u>Button applets outside of the <u>i</u>B-IDE?<br>
        <br>
        </em><strong>Answer:<br>
        </strong>
	<p>Building a Java Powered <u>i</u>Button applet outside of the
	<u>i</u>B-IDE is a two step process.  First you must compile the
	applet into a class file (or files), then you must build a .jib
	file from the class file(s).</p>
	<strong>Compiling:<br></strong>

	Find the file <b>rt.jar</b> on your system.  On a Windows system,
	it might be located in <em>C:\Program Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.2\lib\rt.jar</em>.<br><br>

	Also determine the Java Powered <u>i</u>Button version that you will be
	building for.  You can determine this using 
	APDUSender.  From the firmware version string, determine the 
	database file to use from the <a href="database.html"><u>i</u>Button Database</a>
	page.  This file will be in the form <b>jibXX.jibdb</b>, where XX is a two digit number, unless
	you are building for a 1998 Java-One version of the Java Powered <u>i</u>Button, in which
	case you will need the file <b>javaone.jibdb</b>.  You will also need to find the file 
	<b>iButtonXX.jar</b>, with the same XX as for the database file (you will need <b>iButton32.jar</b>
	for a 1998 Java-One <u>i</u>Button).<br><br>
	
	To compile from a prompt, type:<br>
	<code>javac -bootclasspath "d:\iBIDE\class\iButtonXX.jar;C:\Program 
		Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.2\lib\rt.jar" mysource.java</code><br><br>

	<strong>Building the Applet:<br></strong>
	Find the file <b>jib.jar</b>.  The <u>i</u>B-IDE places this file in a folder 
	in your JDK's directory structure (in the <em>jre\lib\ext</em> path).  For instance,
	it might be in <em>C:\jdk1.2.1\jre\lib\ext</em>.<br><br>

	To build from a prompt, type:<br>
	<code>java -classpath c:\jdk1.2.1\jre\lib\ext\jib.jar;%classpath% BuildJiBlet -f mysource.class 
		-o mysource.jib -d jibXX.jibdb</code><br><br>

	<strong>Making an applet from multiple files:<br></strong>
	To make a Java Powered <u>i</u>Button applet from several class files, only 
	a slight modification from the above is necessary.<br><br>

	Build your class files normally by adding the extra class files to the end of the 
	command line shown above:<br>
	<code>javac -bootclasspath "d:\iBIDE\class\iButtonXX.jar;C:\Program 
		Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.2\lib\rt.jar" mysource.java myobject.java</code><br><br>
	Then move your class files to a new directory.  In this example, assume we've moved the
	files mysource.class and myobject.class to a directory called <em>build</em>.  No other
	files exist in that directory.  Now to build the applet:<br>
	<code>java -classpath c:\jdk1.2.1\jre\lib\ext\jib.jar;%classpath% BuildJiBlet -f build 
		-o mysource.jib -d jibXX.jibdb</code><br><br>

	applications that talk to the Java Powered <u>i</u>Button 
	from outside of the <u>i</u>B-IDE?<br>
        <br>
        </em><strong>Answer:<br></strong>
	You will need to include the following files in your classpath:<br>
	<ol>
		<li>base-core.jar (if you are using OpenCard API code)</li>
		<li>base-opt.jar (if you are using OpenCard API code)</li>
		<li>comm.jar (if you are using a pure Java serial port implementation)</li>
                <li>OneWireAPI.jar</li>
		<li>selector.jar (only if you are using the old JiBAPI code)</li>
		<li>deprecated_jibapi.jar (only if you are using the old JiBAPI code)</li>
	</ol>
	These files are placed in your JDK's lib\ext directory by the <u>i</u>B-IDE 
	installation program, for instance they might be in <em>C:\jdk1.2.1\jre\lib\ext</em>.
	You can add these to your classpath in several ways.
	<ol>
	<li>	You can set the environment variable on your system.  For instance, on Windows
		machines you can type<br><br>
		<code>set classpath=.;c:\jdk1.2.1\jre\lib\ext\base-core.jar;c:\jdk1.2.1\jre\lib\ext\base-opt.jar;c:\jdk1.2.1\jre\lib\ext\comm.jar;c:\jdk1.2.1\lib\ext\OneWire.jar</code><br><br>
		This can also be done from a batch file (like autoexec.bat) or a script.<br><br>
	</li>

	<li>	You can set the classpath if you are building from a development tool.  
		For instance, in Visual Cafe, under the PROJECTS menu, select OPTIONS, 
		then select the DIRECTORIES tab.  Add the jar files to your classpath
		here.<br><br>
	</li>

	<li>	You can specify the classpath in your command.  For instance, to compile, type:<br><br>
		<code>javac -classpath .;c:\jdk1.2.1\jre\lib\ext\base-core.jar;c:\jdk1.2.1\jre\lib\ext\base-opt.jar;c:\jdk1.2.1\jre\lib\ext\comm.jar;c:\jdk1.2.1\lib\ext\OneWire.jar myHostSource.java</code><br><br>
		You can also specify a classpath to run the project.<br><br>
		<code>java -classpath .;c:\jdk1.2.1\jre\lib\ext\base-core.jar;c:\jdk1.2.1\jre\lib\ext\base-opt.jar;c:\jdk1.2.1\jre\lib\ext\comm.jar;c:\jdk1.2.1\lib\ext\OneWire.jar myHostSource</code><br><br>
	</li>

	</ol>
        <i>Note: If you are only using 1-Wire API specific code, then your command line will look like this:</i>
          <pre><code>   java -classpath .;c:\jdk1.2.1\jre\lib\ext\OneWireAPI.jar myHostSource</code></pre>
        <i>You might also need to include <b>comm.jar</b> if using a pure serial adapter.</i>

        <p>
	If you are using the OpenCard API, you must also have the file <b>opencard.properties</b> 
        in your <em>[jdk]\jre\lib</em> directory.  If you are using the 1-Wire API, the <b>onewire.properties</b>
        file must be in the same location.  These files select which port you are going to use for 
        communication with the <u>i</u>Button.  See <a href="#opencard">the discussion on 
        OpenCardPropertyLoadingException</a> for more details on this file, or visit 
        <a href="http://www.opencard.org">the OpenCard website</a>.  For more on the <b>onewire.properties</b>
        file, see <a href="OWAPI.html#default">the 1-Wire API discussion</a>.

   <li><i>What does &quot;Exception opencard.core.util.OpenCardPropertyLoadingException:

	<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
	The program is trying to find the file <b>opencard.properties</b> on your system to 
	determine which port it should use to communicate with the <u>i</u>Buttons.  It should
	be located in your <em>[jdk]\jre\lib</em> directory.  The contents
	the file should look something like this (on a Windows machine):
	<code><pre>
        #Only the last uncommented line will be used to search for iButtons.
        #Uncomment the next line to search COM1 using native code
        #OpenCard.terminals=com.dalsemi.onewire.jib.terminal.JiBCardTerminalFactory|OneWireAdapter|ONEWIRE_PORT_TYPE_LEGACY_SERIAL|COM1

        #Uncomment the next line to search COM1 using pure java code
        OpenCard.terminals=com.dalsemi.onewire.jib.terminal.JiBCardTerminalFactory|OneWireAdapter|ONEWIRE_PORT_TYPE_SERIAL|COM1

        #Uncomment the next line to search COM2 using native code
        #OpenCard.terminals=com.dalsemi.onewire.jib.terminal.JiBCardTerminalFactory|OneWireAdapter|ONEWIRE_PORT_TYPE_LEGACY_SERIAL|COM2

        #This line will search the LPT1 for iButtons.
        #OpenCard.terminals=com.dalsemi.onewire.jib.terminal.JiBCardTerminalFactory|OneWireAdapter|ONEWIRE_PORT_TYPE_LEGACY_PARALLEL|LPT1

        #Uncomment the next line to search LPT2 using native code
        #OpenCard.terminals=com.dalsemi.onewire.jib.terminal.JiBCardTerminalFactory|OneWireAdapter|ONEWIRE_PORT_TYPE_LEGACY_PARALLEL|LPT2
        </code></pre>
	In this case, parallel port 1 will be searched for <u>i</u>Buttons.<br>
	<br>
        Note that previous versions of the Java <u>i</u>Button API used lines like the following their opencard files:
        <code><pre>
	OpenCard.terminals=com.ibutton.oc.terminal.jib.iButtonCardTerminalFactory|iButtonAdapter|iBUTTON_PORT_TYPE_LEGACY_SERIAL|COM1<br>
	</pre></code>
        This has been changed with the new version of the Java <u>i</u>Button API, which is now a part of the 1-Wire API.  
        However, the old line format is still supported through deprecated classes.<br><br>
	If you continue to have problems with this exception, you might also try 
	copying the <b>opencard.properties</b> file into your working directory.<br>

    </li>
<a name="generate"></a><hr>
   <li><i>How can I generate RSA keys in the Java Powered <u>i</u>Button?</i> 
	<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br>
	Only the most recent version (2.2) of the Java Powered <u>i</u>Button 
	can generate an RSA keyset.  This functionality is available in the
	<code>com.dalsemi.security.RSAKeyGenerator</code> class.<br>
	<br>
	Previous versions of the <u>i</u>Button that support RSA operations must have
	their keysets generated outside the <u>i</u>Button, then loaded into 
	the <u>i</u>Button.  Note that some keyset generation programs (including
        any code in Java that uses the <code>BigInteger</code> class to create primes)
        can sometimes create what appears to be a prime of N+1 bytes instead of the
        requested N bytes (for instance, your prime will be 129 bytes instead of 128).
        In most cases, this extra byte is a leading zero attached to ensure the prime 
        is not interpreted as a negative number.  You can usually truncate this leading 
        byte.

<a name="20"></a><hr>
   <li><i>Does Sun's new HotSpot work with the <u>i</u>B-IDE?</i>
	<p><strong>Answer: </strong><br>
	Yes! Previous versions of the <u>i</u>B-IDE used older
        native libraries that conformed to the stubs interface,
        not supported by HotSpot and only supported in the JDK 
        through the use of the <code>-classic</code> switch.
        However, since the Java Powered <u>i</u>Button API has
        been rewritten to be a part of the 1-Wire API, the native
        libraries now conform to the JNI interface, meaning they

	<p><strong>Answer: </strong><br>
	Unix users can choose to specify the path to the desired 
	VM if it doesn't appear in the available list.  Java 
	InstallShield will search the PATH for available VM's, so 
	adding the desired VM bin directory to the PATH (as the

	</p>
	<p>On Windows systems, Java InstallShield currently searches

    <li><i>What do all of the many exceptions mean that appear in 
	the Messages window when I'm using the online help system?</i>
	<p><strong>Answer: </strong><br>
	<u>i</u>B-IDE's online help system is built around the JavaHelp 
	API.  There are several JavaHelp documented bugs pertaining to 
	harmless exceptions being thrown when using the API.  If the 
	help system is responding correctly despite the numerous 
	exceptions being thrown, you can safely ignore the exceptions.  
	You can always clear the exceptions from your display by 
	right clicking in the Message window and choosing to clear 
	messages.

    <li><i>How do I get started programming?</i>
	<p><strong>Answer: </strong><br>
	<u>i</u>B-IDE's online help system has several tutorials that 
	walk you through step-by-step writing your first <u>i</u>Button 
	project.  The tutorials are located under Project Creation in 
	the online help and are called Host and Applet Tutorial and 
	Applet and APDUSender Tutorial.

    <li><i>When I use the Project Wizard to create a new Project 
	I get the error: &quot;java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: 
	bad position: ...&quot; What does this mean?</i>
	<p><strong>Answer: </strong><br>
	This error is caused by running previous versions of
	<u>i</u>B-IDE under JDK 1.2.2. This JDK release introduced several 
	incompatibilities making it unusable with 
	<u>i</u>B-IDE.  This problem has been accounted for in the current
	release of <u>i</u>B-IDE.  If you experience this problem, please

<a name="clock"></a><hr>
    <li><i>How do I read the Java Powered <u>i</u>Button's real time clock?</i>
	<p><strong>Answer: </strong><br>
	Use <code>com.dalsemi.system.Clock.getClock()</code>.  It is a static
	method returning an <code>int</code> that contains the current value 
	of the clock in seconds.

<a name="card"></a><hr>
    <li><i>Is the Java Powered <u>i</u>Button the same thing as a Java 
	Card?  Will my code for the <u>i</u>Button work on a Java Card?</i>
	<p><strong>Answer: </strong><br>
	The Java Powered <u>i</u>Button conforms to the Java Card 2.0
	specification.  It communicates through APDUs and implements
	the javacard.framework package.  Programs written that adhere to the
	Java Card standard will run on both the <u>i</u>Button and
	a typical &quot;smart-card-like&quot; Java Card.  However, you 
	will not be able to take the jib file (the converted applet) 
	and run it on another Java Card.  Once the source has been compiled,
	it must be converted to a hardware specific format (this is what
	the BuildJiBlet tool does).<br>
	<br>
	Also, be aware of differences between Java Card implementations.
	The Java Powered <u>i</u>Button supports the Java Card cryptography
	extensions, which are optional in the Java Card specification.  There
	are also a number of <u>i</u>Button specific classes (the <code>
	com.dalsemi</code> packages) that will not be supported on other Java
	Cards.  In addition, the Java Powered <u>i</u>Button supports 
	integers (<code>int</code>), which is not included in the Java Card
	specification.

<a name="classpath"></a><hr>
    <li><i>How can I modify my classpath to include more files in my 
        <u>i</u>B-IDE applications?</i>
	<p><strong>Answer: </strong><br>
        The 1.10 Release of <u>i</u>B-IDE now has support for modifying
	classpaths.  There are two CLASSPATH buttons on the 
	project window--one for 
	the applet and one for the host.

    <li><i>When I use APDU Sender's Get Last Error function, the 
        response is "None or Coprocessor".  What does this mean?</i>
	<p><strong>Answer: </strong><br>
	Due to an oversight in the Java Powered <u>i</u>Button
	Firmware Release 2.2.0007 only, the exception code byte for
	a <code>CoprocessorException</code> is 0x00, which is also
	the response from an <u>i</u>Button Get Last Error call that
	means "No Error".  If you perform a Get Last Error immediately
	after recieving a 0x6F00 (Uncaught Exception), a response of
	0x00 should mean "CoprocessorException".

<a name="jce"></a><hr>
    <li><i>My applet uses the <u>i</u>Button's cryptographic
        features.  Can I debug it using the emulator?</i>
	<p><strong>Answer: </strong><br>
	The 1.10 Release of <u>i</u>B-IDE now has support for 
	debugging applets that use the <u>i</u>Button's 
	cryptographic functions.  In order to avoid legal 
	issues, you must download Sun's Java
	Cryptography Extension (JCE) from <a href=
	"http://www.javasoft.com/products/jce/index.html">
	"http://www.javasoft.com/products/jce/index.html"</a>.
	The JCE includes a JAR file that you must put in your 
	classpath, either by including it manually or by putting
	the file in the same directory <u>i</u>B-IDE puts the files
	jibapi.jar, exportable_ocf.jar, and others:  
	[JDK home]/jre/lib/ext.<br>
	<br>
	Note that you can still use the emulators without 
	downloading the JCE, but you will not be able to access 
	the emulated cryptographic features.<br>
	<br>
	This release of <u>i</u>B-IDE was developed using JCE 1.2.

    <li><i>I've set my breakpoints, but they don't show
	up beside the code--they show up several lines 
	down.  What is going on?</i>
	<p><strong>Answer: </strong><br>
	This can occur when the fonts used by <u>i</u>B-IDE 
	cannot be found.  The program will use default fonts
	instead, but the breakpoints are positioned based on
	the size of the requested fonts.  The breakpoints 
	are really there, they are just being drawn in the 
	wrong place.

<a name="lu_files"></a><hr>
    <li><i>When <u>i</u>B-IDE compiles, it creates files
        with extensions "lu1" and "lu2".  What are these?</i>
	<p><strong>Answer: </strong><br>
        These files contain debug information about the applet,
        matching code to line number and storing the class and
        method numbers for the applet.  They are mainly used
        by the emulator for implementing breakpoints.  If you are
        building applets without using the <u>i</u>B-IDE, you do 
        not need to build these files.  However, if you would like
        to look at this debug information, use the '-b' and
        '-j' switches of BuildJiBlet.

<a name="cleanup"></a><hr>
    <li><i>When running an OpenCard application in <u>i</u>B-IDE, 
        it keeps reporting that a card is inserted 2 or 3 times, but I only have
        one button inserted.  What is happening?</i>
	<p><strong>Answer: </strong><br>
        <u>i</u>B-IDE does not run programs in a new process, but rather runs them
        by calling their main method in a thread.  This allows <u>i</u>B-IDE to 
        use the <u>i</u>Button Emulator.  However, this makes cleaning up
        hard, because listeners for <u>i</u>Button events might not go away.
        What is happening in this case is that OpenCard has several listeners
        that registered themselves with previous runs of your program, and could
        not be cleaned up.  To work around this problem, you can do either of the 
        following:
        <ol>
          <li>Restart <u>i</u>B-IDE.
          <li>Write a static <code>cleanUp()</code> method into your host.  To work,
              this must be in the same class file that implements 
              <code>opencard.core.event.CTListener</code>.  This method will be called from
              <u>i</u>B-IDE after your program terminates.  The following code is used
              in the OpenCard host source templates.  Do the same thing in your code
              make sure <u>i</u>B-IDE can clean up properly.<code><pre>
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        //The following path has been auto-generated by
        //the Project Wizard.  If the project is moved
        //to a different directory, you MUST update this
        //path accordingly.
        ct_listener_object = new MyHost( . . . );
    }

    private static CTListener ct_listener_object = null;

    public static void cleanUp()
    {
        if (ct_listener_object!=null)
        {
            CardTerminalRegistry reg = CardTerminalRegistry.getRegistry();
            reg.removeCTListener(ct_listener_object);
        }
    }</pre></code>
        </ol>
        Note that this will only work within <u>i</u>B-IDE.  You should not see
        this problem outside of <u>i</u>B-IDE.
        </p>
